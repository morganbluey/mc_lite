# Cryptic Clue Player - Educational Recreation

## Project Overview
This project is a custom-built web application designed to play through cryptic crossword clues. It was created as a technical exercise to independently replicate the core gameplay mechanics of a word-puzzle interface.

## Inspiration
The project is heavily inspired by Minute Cryptic (minutecryptic.com). It aims to honor the original concept while providing a modified, streamlined experience for enthusiasts of the genre.

## Core Purpose and Differences
The primary goal of this application is to provide a "pure" gameplay experience. Unlike the original Minute Cryptic, this version is intentionally stripped of several features to focus strictly on the challenge of the clue itself.

Key differences in this version include:
- No Hint System: There are no built-in hints or reveal options. The player must solve the clue based solely on the wordplay and definition.
- Simplified UI: Menu elements and navigation bars have been removed to minimize distractions.
- No Par/Scoring System: The "Par" indicator and performance tracking from the original have been omitted.
- Focus on Persistence: The logic is designed for players to cycle through clues, allowing them to skip and return to unsolved riddles until they are completed without assistance.

## Content Attribution
The riddles and clues used in this project are the intellectual property of their original creators. This software serves only as a custom interface to display that content for personal, educational use.
